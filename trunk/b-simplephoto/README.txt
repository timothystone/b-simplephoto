==== Building  simplephotogalleryplugin (SimplePhoto, a.k.a b-simplephoto)====

Ant should be on your executable path. Unless you have a reason, the latest 
version of ant is recommended. 1.6.5 is the minimum required. This can be 
overriden in the build.xml file.

Don't know what ant is? http://ant.apache.org/
