# blojsom simplephoto #
Building on the robust support for metadata in blojsom, this photo album plugin provides a simple display of photos in a blog post. The plugin exploits the natural hierarchy of the filesystem to organize photos.

The aggregator view provides a linked thumbnail, while the permalink, or post, view loads a meta data driven, JavaScript powered photo album that is pagable and supports landscape and portrait photos.

This first release is rather rough around the edges, lacking refinements in installation and initial configuration that will be improved on in later releases, including configurable landscape and portrait widths, as well as caption support. A binary download and complete documentation set will be available soon.

While configuration of the plugin might be anything other than simple, because of the nature of, and integration into, standard and custom themes, do not let this dichotomy of word use deter you from giving it a try in your blojsom blog.

## About version ##
b-simplephoto is supported only in blojsom 2.x. A blojsom 3.x version is being developed. You are encouraged to take the idea and extend it to blojsom 3.0 at your leisure.

## About blojsom 2 ##
blojsom 2 is a Java-based, full-featured, multi-blog, multi-user software package that was inspired by blosxom. blojsom aims to retain a simplicity in design while adding flexibility in areas such as the flavors, templating, plugins, and the ability to run multiple blogs with a single blojsom installation.
