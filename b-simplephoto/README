==== BUILDING ==================================================================

Ant should be on your executable path. Unless you have a reason, the latest 
version of ant is recommended. 1.6.5 is the minimum required. This can be 
overriden in the build.xml file.

Don't know what ant is? http://ant.apache.org/

The simplephotogalleryplugin can be built on the command line, as a NetBeans 
project, or imported into your favorite IDE.

% ant

This will build the default ant target and the binary will be located in the
resulting dist folder.
